When you are starting in an Array you start from zero

int [] tenMult = {10, 20 , 30, 40, 50, 60};
                  [0] [1]  [2] [3] [4] [5]
if you do System.out.print(tenMult[3]); The output of this answe
would be 40 

Anytime you input is you put a for loop because you know exactly 
what number you want
--------------------------------------------------

Score array 

{10, 20 , 30, 40, 50, 60};
[0]  [1]  [2] [3] [4] [5]

for (sub = 0; sub < 5; ++sub)
scoreArray[sub] += 3;

 -> score array[sub] = ScoreArray[sub] + 3;

 step one look if 5 is greater then zero if not the value is getting 
 overwritten, so now you are added 3 so instead of 10 it will be 13

 overwriting the value and by adding 3 till it reaches the 5th array
 ----------------------------------------------------

 My own interpretation >> whenever you are calling on an array either if its 
 3 or one they all start from 0- thrugh whatever other number there is

 in the example wherre there was a for loop each array can be connected with 
 its own name. and from there it will read or save whatever is in that array a
 and store the data till when needed the ++ was used for when you want
 keep count and it just increments by one.       for example [ ++ count] >> it would keep
 the count and save the progress of how much the system had stored
